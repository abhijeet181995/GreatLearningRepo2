# GL Blockchain Capstone Project - Team 2

## Introduction/Overview

Traditional credential management involves manual verification which can lead to multiple issues like forgery, data manipulation, long verification times, no more availability of institutes to verify the data. The system involves below participants

- Student – Regular board students or continuing education students
- Educational Institute – defining courses & assigning students to courses
- Corporations – Private organizations who can verify the issued credentials

## Goals/Objectives

Our goal is to reimagine the concept of credential verification. Our objective is to use blockchain for verification of credentials. Also, utilize the distributed and decentralized infrastructure for credential verification. Regulated entities need to publish and verify standardized test scores and transcripts on a blockchain. Private organizations and their recruiters can verify skill-based training certificates, vocational course certificates or executive education. Platforms such as Great Learning can participate in the system & help organizations launch specific skill-based course certifications on blockchain

The system should help in building transparency among all stakeholders throughout the process. Through this transparency, students and verifying organizations should benefit greatly as the time consuming manual processes are avoided. The system should be easy to adopt for any certificate issuing organization and verifying organization. The certificates issued once should not be modifiable. The system should help in automating the generation & verification of credentials for all participating entities.
